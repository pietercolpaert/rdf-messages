# RDF messages

This proposal introduces an extra concept on top of RDF, called RDF messages, so that quads can be grouped together as an atomical unit.

Read the proposal at [https://www.pieter.pm/rdf-messages](https://www.pieter.pm/rdf-messages).

This is a proposed for the [W3C RSP CG](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/rsp/)


## Build the spec

We use bikeshed with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/):

```bash
pipx run bikeshed spec index.bs
```
