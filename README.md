# RDF messages

The RDF data model defines the concept of a statement with a subject, predicate, object and context.

This proposal introduces an extra concept called RDF messages, so that quads can be grouped together as an atomical unit.


## Build the spec

We use bikeshed:

```bash
pipx run bikeshed spec index.bs
```
